AR-DBCopy

Simple script to copy data from one database to another.
This script can be used to migrate from one Database system
to another one, e.q. when the SQL dumps are not compatible.
Database agnosticism is achieved by using ActiveRecord.

The script just defines 2 connections, looks at the tables,
creates ActiveRecord model classes on-the-fly and copies over
the data.

Configure the databases using the database.yml.example as a
template (the format is the same as Rails's database.yml)

Then, run the script. The script only copies data, not structure,
so make sure that you created the schema  and all tables in
the destination database already (use rake db:schema:load)
